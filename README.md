# 🗄️ SQL Business Analysis Project






# 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of SQL queries to extract, analyze, and generate actionable insights from a company’s suppliers, products, customers, and orders data.

The analysis highlights supplier networks, customer distribution, product trends, and sales performance. A Business Insights Report was also generated from the SQL outputs.

# 📊 Business Insights Report
1. Supplier & Product Insights

The company has a diverse supplier base across the UK, Germany, France, and the USA.

Some suppliers contribute more products, making them key partners.

Jar-packaged products may target niche or specialty markets.

Product availability tracking supports faster inventory checks.

2. Customer Insights

Countries with 10+ customers are strong candidates for targeted marketing.

A premium customer group was identified with average orders between $1,000–$1,200.

3. Sales & Order Trends

January 2013 orders show seasonal sales patterns → useful for forecasting.

Identifying top-spending customers supports loyalty programs.

Order analysis reveals variations in demand, pricing, and quantity.

4. Language & Communication

Suppliers mapped to native languages for localized communication.

Supports better supplier relationship management and service delivery.

5. Market Focus & Strategic Opportunities

Countries with >2 suppliers or >10 customers = high-growth markets.
